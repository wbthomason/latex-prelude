# latex-prelude
My standard LaTeX prelude defining common packages used, helpful commands, etc. Use at your own
risk; although most of this is pretty generally good, it does contain some me-specific features
(such as commands for my advisor and I to make comments tagged with our initials, etc.)

If you decide to use it, either place `prelude.sty` in your LaTeX project root directory or in your
user's `texmf` directory (usually `~/texmf/tex/latex/prelude` for this package in particular).
